## Project Name
Cloud File Backup System

## Project Description
The Cloud File Backup System is a secure digital platform that allows users to store, protect, and retrieve important files using remote cloud infrastructure instead of relying only on physical devices like phones, laptops, or external drives. In today’s digital world, people depend heavily on electronic devices to store documents, photos, academic work, business records, and personal information. However, these devices are vulnerable to loss, theft, hardware failure, malware attacks, or accidental deletion. When such incidents occur, valuable data can be permanently lost.
This project provides a reliable solution by automatically or manually backing up files to remote servers hosted in the cloud. Because the files are stored online, users can access them anytime, anywhere, and from any internet-connected device.

The system uses cloud storage infrastructure provided by modern cloud computing platforms to ensure scalability, availability, and security.

The Real-World Problem It Solves
Many individuals and organizations suffer from data loss due to device crashes or hardware failure, accidental file deletion, theft or loss of devices, virus or ransomware attacks, limited storage space on devices, and lack of backup awareness.
For students, losing coursework can delay academic progress. For businesses, losing records can result in financial loss and operational disruption. For individuals, losing personal memories such as photos and videos can be emotionally devastating.
The Cloud File Backup System addresses these risks by ensuring that data is securely stored in a remote environment that is protected, redundant, and continuously available.
