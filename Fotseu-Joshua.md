# CampusNest — Student Housing Finder for Cameroon

## Project Description
CampusNest is a cloud-native, AI-powered housing marketplace that connects 
university students in Cameroon with verified landlords and cite managers. 
The platform allows students to search, filter, and book accommodation in 
cities like Yaoundé, Buea, and Douala, solving the critical problem of 
housing access for students relocating for university. It is built on AWS 
serverless architecture and integrates AI/ML services including Amazon 
Rekognition, Amazon Personalize, Amazon Kendra, and Amazon SageMaker.
