## Project name: iLens

# Project Description
iLens is a mobile application that transforms screenshots from static images into actionable interfaces. The product was born from a real, universal frustration: information that is visible inside an image but impossible to act on — a link you cannot tap, an event flyer with a registration URL, a Google Meet invite trapped in a screenshot.

## How It Works

Step 1
User takes a screenshot (any app, any content)
Step 2
iLens detects the screenshot via Media Store Observer
Step 3
On-device AI analyzes image — determines if actionable content exists
Step 4
If actionable: overlay appears with relevant action buttons
Step 5
If not actionable: iLens stays silent. No noise, no interruption.
