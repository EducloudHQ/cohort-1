## Project name: OctoCare

# Project Description
OctoCare is a conversational AI health companion designed to improve access to timely medical care across African communities using familiar messaging platforms such as WhatsApp.

Through structured conversations via text or voice, OctoCare helps users organize symptoms, evaluates urgency using a hybrid clinical rule engine and AI reasoning, and provides clear guidance on appropriate next steps.

Instead of diagnosing illnesses, OctoCare focuses on triage and care coordination. The system categorizes cases into urgency levels, recommends nearby healthcare facilities, and generates structured pre-arrival summaries that can be shared with providers to reduce intake delays and improve patient prioritization.
